## Hello from me!

Welcome to CS Major at Northwestern! Hope you will find some useful information on this website. A little bit about me:

Iâ€™m a computer science student with a strong interest in both the theoretical and practical sides of the field. I enjoy solving problems through code, working on hands-on projects, and exploring how technology can be applied to different areas.

I am a sophomore at Weinberg with a MLDS minor. I am doing research in CS (topic: machine learning). I also plan to study abroad in Ireland.
