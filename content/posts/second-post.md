## CS + X explained (from McCormick site)

The Computer Science + X (CS+X) initiative at Northwestern University explodes the possibilities of interdisciplinary research. Our goal is to foster transformational relationships between computer science and intersecting fields and establish connections across the University.

Through CS+X, students and faculty are expanding the boundaries of computer science and can potentially spark entirely new fields of study. Undergraduate students from departments throughout the university connect computing to their academic interests via courses relevant to non-majors. The Northwestern CS PhD program is designed to encourage students to pursue broad research interests and collaborate with advisors both in CS and other disciplines. CS faculty build interdisciplinary research teams spanning schools and departments and collaborate with external industry and partners.
