## CS Concentrations (by Sara Sood)
Many of you have asked how to declare that concentration, so I wanted to share this information with everyone. 

For Weinberg CS majors, you will simply need to fill out the major declaration form again, and list your concentration on that form. Once youâ€™ve completed the form, you can send it to Yas Klenk (yassaman.klenk@northwestern.edu). 

For McCormick CS majors, you can now declare your concentration in MAS. Here are the steps.

Change catalog year to 2024-25 by May 1st (if you are a spring 25 grad).
The Undergraduate Engineering Office updates major and catalog changes on Fridays.
Once the catalog change is visible in MAS, look for the Concentration Declaration on the Dashboard
Declare the concentration by May 23rd (if you are a spring 25 grad) by selecting a concentration, adding 4 approved classes, and submitting the form
Please be sure to only use specific Special Topics courses (396/397) that are approved for the specific concentration
If you are a BS/MS student, please remember that courses intended for the MS program cannot be used toward a concentration  
Once approved by the CS department, you will see a Concentration tab in MAS, like the Theme tab.
