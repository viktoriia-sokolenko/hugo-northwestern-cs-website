The **Computer Science major at Northwestern University** combines solid technical training with opportunities to explore other fields. Students learn core topics such as programming, algorithms, systems, artificial intelligence, and software development. The program offers both BA and BS degrees, with the BA housed in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and the BS in the McCormick School of Engineering. Students can also declare concentrations: *Artificial Intelligence, Systems, Security and Privacy, Software Engineering and Programming Languages, Robotics, Computer Hardware and Architecture, Human-Computer Interaction*.

Many CS classes are project-based, allowing students to build real applications and work in teams. Outside the classroom, students can join research groups, tech clubs like DISC and IEEE, or participate in hackathons. The program encourages both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience, and many students go on to work in software engineering, research, or graduate school. Northwestern also supports interdisciplinary work, making it possible to apply CS skills in fields like journalism, music, and biology.
